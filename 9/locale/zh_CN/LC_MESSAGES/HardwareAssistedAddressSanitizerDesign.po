":doc:`AddressSanitizer` tags every 8 bytes of the application memory with a "
"1 byte tag (using *shadow memory*), uses *redzones* to find buffer-overflows "
"and *quarantine* to find use-after-free. The redzones, the quarantine, and, "
"to a less extent, the shadow, are the sources of AddressSanitizer's memory "
"overhead. See the `AddressSanitizer paper`_ for details."

"AArch64 has the `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware "

"Pointer tags between 1 to `TG-1` are possible and are as likely as any other "
