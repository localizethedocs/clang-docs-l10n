msgid ""
"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=address`` flag.  The "
"AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, "
"so make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step.  When "
"linking shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked, so ``-"
"Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer).  To "
"get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher.  To get nicer stack "
"traces in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``.  To get perfect "
"stack traces you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail "
"call elimination (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``)."

"If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and "
"exit with a non-zero exit code. AddressSanitizer exits on the first detected "
"error. This is by design:"

"generated code (both by ~5%)."

"Fixing bugs becomes unavoidable. AddressSanitizer does not produce false "
"alarms. Once a memory corruption occurs, the program is in an inconsistent "
"state, which could lead to confusing results and potentially misleading "

"If your process is sandboxed and you are running on OS X 10.10 or earlier, "

"point it to the ASan library that is packaged with the compiler used to "
"build the executable. (You can find the library by searching for dynamic "
"libraries with ``asan`` in their name.) If the environment variable is not "
"set, the process will try to re-exec. Also keep in mind that when moving the "
"executable to another machine, the ASan library will also need to be copied "

"unblock yourself and continue on with the testing. This suppression "
"mechanism should only be used for suppressing issues in external code; it "
"does not work on code recompiled with AddressSanitizer. To suppress errors "
"in external libraries, set the ``ASAN_OPTIONS`` environment variable to "
