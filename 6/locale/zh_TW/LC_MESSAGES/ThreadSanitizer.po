"ThreadSanitizer is a tool that detects data races.  It consists of a "
"compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.  Typical slowdown "
"introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about **5x-15x**.  Typical memory overhead "
"introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about **5x-10x**."

msgid ""
"ThreadSanitizer is supported on Linux x86_64 (tested on Ubuntu 12.04). "
"Support for other 64-bit architectures is possible, contributions are "
"welcome. Support for 32-bit platforms is problematic and is not planned."

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ThreadSanitizer.rst:27
msgid ""
"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=thread``.  To get a "
"reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher.  Use ``-g`` to get file names "
"and line numbers in the warning messages."

"If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr. "
"Currently, ThreadSanitizer symbolizes its output using an external "
"``addr2line`` process (this will be fixed in future)."

"Some code should not be instrumented by ThreadSanitizer.  One may use the "
"function attribute ``no_sanitize(\"thread\")`` to disable instrumentation of "
"plain (non-atomic) loads/stores in a particular function.  ThreadSanitizer "
"still instruments such functions to avoid false positives and provide "
"meaningful stack traces.  This attribute may not be supported by other "
"compilers, so we suggest to use it together with "
"``__has_feature(thread_sanitizer)``."

msgid ""
"ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in :doc:"
"`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports "
"in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with "
"``no_sanitize(\"thread\")`` attribute, blacklisted functions are not "
"instrumented at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed "
"synchronization via atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports."

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ThreadSanitizer.rst:109
msgid ""
"ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default "
"settings the memory overhead is 5x plus 1Mb per each thread. Settings with "
"3x (less accurate analysis) and 9x (more accurate analysis) overhead are "
"also available."

#: ../../../ThreadSanitizer.rst:113

"ThreadSanitizer maps (but does not reserve) a lot of virtual address space. "
"This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as usually expected."

msgid "Libc/libstdc++ static linking is not supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ThreadSanitizer.rst:116
msgid ""
"Non-position-independent executables are not supported.  Therefore, the "
"``fsanitize=thread`` flag will cause Clang to act as though the ``-fPIE`` "
"flag had been supplied if compiling without ``-fPIC``, and as though the ``-"
"pie`` flag had been supplied if linking an executable."

"ThreadSanitizer is in beta stage.  It is known to work on large C++ programs "
"using pthreads, but we do not promise anything (yet).  C++11 threading is "
"supported with llvm libc++.  The test suite is integrated into CMake build "
"and can be run with ``make check-tsan`` command."

"We are actively working on enhancing the tool --- stay tuned.  Any help, "
