":doc:`AddressSanitizer` tags every 8 bytes of the application memory with a "
"1 byte tag (using *shadow memory*), uses *redzones* to find buffer-overflows "
"and *quarantine* to find use-after-free. The redzones, the quarantine, and, "
"to a less extent, the shadow, are the sources of AddressSanitizer's memory "
"overhead. See the `AddressSanitizer paper`_ for details."

"AArch64 has the `Address Tagging`_ (or top-byte-ignore, TBI), a hardware "
"feature that allows software to use 8 most significant bits of a 64-bit "
"pointer as a tag. HWASAN uses `Address Tagging`_ to implement a memory "
"safety tool, similar to :doc:`AddressSanitizer`, but with smaller memory "
"overhead and slightly different (mostly better) accuracy guarantees."

"Is less portable than :doc:`AddressSanitizer` as it relies on hardware "
"`Address Tagging`_ (AArch64). Address Tagging can be emulated with compiler "
