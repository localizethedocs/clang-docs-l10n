"*ThinLTO* compilation is a new type of LTO that is both scalable and "
"incremental. *LTO* (Link Time Optimization) achieves better runtime "
"performance through whole-program analysis and cross-module optimization. "
"However, monolithic LTO implements this by merging all input into a single "
"module, which is not scalable in time or memory, and also prevents fast "
"incremental compiles."

#: ../../../ThinLTO.rst:18
msgid ""
"In ThinLTO mode, as with regular LTO, clang emits LLVM bitcode after the "
"compile phase. The ThinLTO bitcode is augmented with a compact summary of "
"the module. During the link step, only the summaries are read and merged "
"into a combined summary index, which includes an index of function locations "
"for later cross-module function importing. Fast and efficient whole-program "
"analysis is then performed on the combined summary index."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ThinLTO.rst:25
msgid ""
"However, all transformations, including function importing, occur later when "
"the modules are optimized in fully parallel backends. By default, linkers_ "
"that support ThinLTO are set up to launch the ThinLTO backends in threads. "
"So the usage model is not affected as the distinction between the fast "
"serial thin link step and the backends is transparent to the user."

"LLVM blog post `ThinLTO: Scalable and Incremental LTO <http://blog.llvm."
"org/2016/06/thinlto-scalable-and-incremental-lto.html>`_. While tuning is "
"still in progress, results in the blog post show that ThinLTO already "
"performs well compared to LTO, in many cases matching the performance "
"improvement."
