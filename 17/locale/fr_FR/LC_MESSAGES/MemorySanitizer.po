"MemorySanitizer is a detector of uninitialized reads. It consists of a "
"compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library."

msgid ""
"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=memory`` flag. The "
"MemorySanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, "
"so make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step. When "
"linking shared libraries, the MemorySanitizer run-time is not linked, so ``-"
"Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with MemorySanitizer). To "
"get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher. To get meaningful stack "
"traces in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect "
"stack traces you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail "
"call elimination (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``)."

"If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and "

msgid ""
"Some code should not be checked by MemorySanitizer.  One may use the "
"function attribute ``no_sanitize(\"memory\")`` to disable uninitialized "
"checks in a particular function.  MemorySanitizer may still instrument such "
"functions to avoid false positives.  This attribute may not be supported by "
"other compilers, so we suggest to use it together with "
"``__has_feature(memory_sanitizer)``."

msgid "``__attribute__((disable_sanitizer_instrumentation))``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:91
msgid ""
"The ``disable_sanitizer_instrumentation`` attribute can be applied to "
"functions to prevent all kinds of instrumentation. As a result, it may "
"introduce false positives and therefore should be used with care, and only "
"if absolutely required; for example for certain code that cannot tolerate "
"any instrumentation and resulting side-effects. This attribute overrides "
"``no_sanitize(\"memory\")``."

msgid ""
"MemorySanitizer can track origins of uninitialized values, similar to "
"Valgrind's --track-origins option. This feature is enabled by ``-fsanitize-"

"Clang option. With the code from the example above,"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:152
msgid ""
"By default, MemorySanitizer collects both allocation points and all "
"intermediate stores the uninitialized value went through.  Origin tracking "
"has proved to be very useful for debugging MemorySanitizer reports. It slows "
"down program execution by a factor of 1.5x-2x on top of the usual "
"MemorySanitizer slowdown and increases memory overhead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:158

"Clang option ``-fsanitize-memory-track-origins=1`` enables a slightly faster "

msgid ""
"MemorySanitizer requires that all program code is instrumented. This also "
"includes any libraries that the program depends on, even libc. Failing to "
"achieve this may result in false reports. For the same reason you may need "
"to replace all inline assembly code that writes to memory with a pure C/C++ "
"code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:186
msgid ""
"Full MemorySanitizer instrumentation is very difficult to achieve. To make "
"it easier, MemorySanitizer runtime library includes 70+ interceptors for the "
"most common libc functions. They make it possible to run MemorySanitizer-"
"instrumented programs linked with uninstrumented libc. For example, the "
"authors were able to bootstrap MemorySanitizer-instrumented Clang compiler "
"by linking it with self-built instrumented libc++ (as a replacement for "
