"HLSL Support is under active development in the Clang codebase. This "

msgid ""
"The long term goal of this project is to enable Clang to function as a "
"replacement for the `DirectXShaderCompiler (DXC) <https://github.com/"
"microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/>`_ in all its supported use cases. "
"Accomplishing that goal will require Clang to be able to process most "
"existing HLSL programs with a high degree of source compatibility."

"HLSL ASTs do not need to be compatible between DXC and Clang. We do not "
"expect identical code generation or that features will resemble DXC's "
"implementation or architecture. In fact, we explicitly expect to deviate "
"from DXC's implementation in key ways."

"This document lacks details for architectural decisions that are not yet "
"finalized. Our top priorities are quality, maintainability, and flexibility. "
"In accordance with community standards we are expecting a high level of test "
"coverage, and we will engineer our solutions with long term maintenance in "
"mind. We are also working to limit modifications to the Clang C++ code paths "
"and share as much functionality as possible."

msgid "Architectural Direction"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:46
msgid ""
"HLSL support in Clang is expressed as C++ minus unsupported C and C++ "
"features. This is different from how other Clang languages are implemented. "
"Most languages in Clang are additive on top of C."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:50
msgid ""
"HLSL is not a formally or fully specified language, and while our goals "
"require a high level of source compatibility, implementations can vary and "
"we have some flexibility to be more or less permissive in some cases. For "
"modern HLSL DXC is the reference implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:55
msgid ""
"The HLSL effort prioritizes following similar patterns for other languages, "
"drivers, runtimes and targets. Specifically, We will maintain separation "
"between HSLS-specific code and the rest of Clang as much as possible "
"following patterns in use in Clang code today (i.e. ParseHLSL.cpp, SemaHLSL."
"cpp, CGHLSL*.cpp...). We will use inline checks on language options where "
"the code is simple and isolated, and prefer HLSL-specific implementation "
"files for any code of reasonable complexity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:63
msgid ""
"In places where the HLSL language is in conflict with C and C++, we will "
"seek to make minimally invasive changes guarded under the HLSL language "
"options. We will seek to make HLSL language support as minimal a maintenance "

msgid ""
"A DXC driver mode will provide command-line compatibility with DXC, "
"supporting DXC's options and flags. The DXC driver is HLSL-specific and will "
"create an HLSLToolchain which will provide the basis to support targeting "
"both DirectX and Vulkan."

msgid "Parser"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:78
msgid ""
"Following the examples of other parser extensions HLSL will add a ParseHLSL."
"cpp file to contain the implementations of HLSL-specific extensions to the "
"Clang parser. The HLSL grammar shares most of its structure with C and C++, "
"so we will use the existing C/C++ parsing code paths."

msgid "Sema"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:86
msgid ""
"HLSL's Sema implementation will also provide an ``ExternalSemaSource``. In "
"DXC, an ``ExternalSemaSource`` is used to provide definitions for HLSL built-"
"in data types and built-in templates. Clang is already designed to allow an "
"attached ``ExternalSemaSource`` to lazily complete data types, which is a "
"**huge** performance win for HLSL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:92
msgid ""
"If precompiled headers are used when compiling HLSL, the "
"``ExternalSemaSource`` will be a ``MultiplexExternalSemaSource`` which "
"includes both the ``ASTReader`` and ``HLSLExternalSemaSource``. For Built-in "
"declarations that are already completed in the serialized AST, the "
"``HLSLExternalSemaSource`` will reuse the existing declarations and not "
"introduce new declarations. If the built-in types are not completed in the "
"serialized AST, the ``HLSLExternalSemaSource`` will create new declarations "
"and connect the de-serialized decls as the previous declaration."

"Like OpenCL, HLSL relies on capturing a lot of information into IR metadata. "
"*hand wave* *hand wave* *hand wave* As a design principle here we want our "
"IR to be idiomatic Clang IR as much as possible. We will use IR attributes "
"wherever we can, and use metadata as sparingly as possible. One example of a "
"difference from DXC already implemented in Clang is the use of target "
"triples to communicate shader model versions and shader stages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:111
msgid ""
"Our HLSL CodeGen implementation should also have an eye toward generating IR "
"that will map directly to targets other than DXIL. While IR itself is "
"generally not re-targetable, we want to share the Clang CodeGen "
"implementation for HLSL with other GPU graphics targets like SPIR-V and "
"possibly other GPU and even CPU targets."

"The HLSL language is insufficiently documented, and not formally specified. "
"Documentation is available on `Microsoft's website <https://docs.microsoft."
"com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl>`_. The language "
"syntax is similar enough to C and C++ that carefully written C and C++ code "
"is valid HLSL. HLSL has some key differences from C & C++ which we will need "
"to handle in Clang."

"HLSL is not a conforming or valid extension or superset of C or C++. The "

msgid "An Aside on GPU Languages"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:134
msgid ""
"Due to HLSL being a GPU targeted language HLSL is a Single Program Multiple "
"Data (SPMD) language relying on the implicit parallelism provided by GPU "
"hardware. Some language features in HLSL enable programmers to take "
"advantage of the parallel nature of GPUs in a hardware abstracted language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:139
msgid ""
"HLSL also prohibits some features of C and C++ which can have catastrophic "
"performance or are not widely supportable on GPU hardware or drivers. As an "
"example, register spilling is often excessively expensive on GPUs, so HLSL "
"requires all functions to be inlined during code generation, and does not "
"support a runtime calling convention."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pointers & References"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:148
msgid ""
"HLSL does not support referring to values by address. Semantically all "
"variables are value-types and behave as such. HLSL disallows the pointer "
"dereference operators (unary ``*``, and ``->``), as well as the address of "
"operator (unary &). While HLSL disallows pointers and references in the "
"syntax, HLSL does use reference types in the AST, and we intend to use "
"pointer decay in the AST in the Clang implementation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:158
msgid ""
"HLSL does support member functions, and (in HLSL 2021) limited operator "
"overloading. With member function support, HLSL also has a ``this`` keyword. "
"The ``this`` keyword is an example of one of the places where HLSL relies on "
"references in the AST, because ``this`` is a reference."

msgid "Bitshifts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:166
msgid ""
"In deviation from C, HLSL bitshifts are defined to mask the shift count by "
"the size of the type. In DXC, the semantics of LLVM IR were altered to "
"accommodate this, in Clang we intend to generate the mask explicitly in the "
"IR. In cases where the shift value is constant, this will be constant folded "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:175
msgid ""
"In HLSL 2018 and earlier, HLSL supported logical operators (and the ternary "
"operator) on vector types. This behavior required that operators not short "
"circuit. The non-short circuiting behavior applies to all data types until "
"HLSL 2021. In HLSL 2021, logical and ternary operators do not support vector "
"types instead builtin functions ``and``, ``or`` and ``select`` are "
"available, and operators short circuit matching C behavior."

msgid "Precise Qualifier"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:185
msgid ""
"HLSL has a ``precise`` qualifier that behaves unlike anything else in the C "
"language. The support for this qualifier in DXC is buggy, so our bar for "
"compatibility is low."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:189
msgid ""
"The ``precise`` qualifier applies in the inverse direction from normal "
"qualifiers. Rather than signifying that the declaration containing "
"``precise`` qualifier be precise, it signifies that the operations "
"contributing to the declaration's value be ``precise``. Additionally, "
"``precise`` is a misnomer: values attributed as ``precise`` comply with "
"IEEE-754 floating point semantics, and are prevented from optimizations "
"which could decrease *or increase* precision."
msgstr ""

msgid "Differences in Templates"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/HLSLSupport.rst:200
msgid ""
"HLSL uses templates to define builtin types and methods, but disallowed user-"
"defined templates until HLSL 2021. HLSL also allows omitting empty template "
"parameter lists when all template parameters are defaulted. This is an "
"ambiguous syntax in C++, but Clang detects the case and issues a diagnostic. "
"This makes supporting the case in Clang minimally invasive."
