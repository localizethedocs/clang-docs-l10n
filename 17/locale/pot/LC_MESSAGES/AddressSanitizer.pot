"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=address`` flag.  The "
"AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, "
"so make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step.  When "
"linking shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked, so ``-"
"Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer).  To "
"get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher.  To get nicer stack "
"traces in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``.  To get perfect "
"stack traces you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail "
"call elimination (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``)."

"If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and "

"error. This is by design:"

"Fixing bugs becomes unavoidable. AddressSanitizer does not produce false "

"If your process is sandboxed and you are running on OS X 10.10 or earlier, "

"build the executable. (You can find the library by searching for dynamic "
"libraries with ``asan`` in their name.) If the environment variable is not "
"set, the process will try to re-exec. Also keep in mind that when moving the "
