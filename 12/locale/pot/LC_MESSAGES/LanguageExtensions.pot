"In order to be consistent with the C language specification, and make the "
"extended integer types useful for their intended purpose, extended integers "
"follow the C standard integer conversion ranks. An extended integer type has "
"a greater rank than any integer type with less precision.  However, they "
"have lower rank than any of the built in or other integer types (such as "
"__int128). Usual arithmetic conversions also work the same, where the "
"smaller ranked integer is converted to the larger."

"The one exception to the C rules for integers for these types is Integer "
"Promotion. Unary +, -, and ~ operators typically will promote operands to "
"``int``. Doing these promotions would inflate the size of required hardware "
"on some platforms, so extended integer types aren't subject to the integer "
"promotion rules in these cases."
