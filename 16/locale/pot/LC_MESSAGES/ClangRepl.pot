"**Clang-Repl** is an interactive C++ interpreter that allows for incremental "
"compilation. It supports interactive programming for C++ in a read-evaluate-"
"print-loop (REPL) style. It uses Clang as a library to compile the high "
"level programming language into LLVM IR. Then the LLVM IR is executed by the "
"LLVM just-in-time (JIT) infrastructure."

"Clang-Repl is suitable for exploratory programming and in places where time "
"to insight is important. Clang-Repl is a project inspired by the work in "
"`Cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`_, a LLVM-based C/C++ "
"interpreter developed by the field of high energy physics and used by the "
"scientific data analysis framework `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_. Clang-Repl "
"allows to move parts of Cling upstream, making them useful and available to "
"a broader audience."

"Just like Clang, Clang-Repl can be integrated in existing applications as a "
"library (via using the clangInterpreter library). This turning your C++ "
"compiler into a service which incrementally can consume and execute code. "
"The **Compiler as A Service** (**CaaS**) concept helps supporting move "
"advanced use cases such as template instantiations on demand and automatic "
"language interoperability. It also helps static languages such as C/C++ "
"become apt for data science."
