":program:`clang` is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler which encompasses "
"preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code generation, assembly, and "
"linking. Depending on which high-level mode setting is passed, Clang will "
"stop before doing a full link.  While Clang is highly integrated, it is "
"important to understand the stages of compilation, to understand how to "
"invoke it.  These stages are:"

"The clang executable is actually a small driver which controls the overall "

"This stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a "
"parse tree.  Once in the form of a parse tree, it applies semantic analysis "
"to compute types for expressions as well and determine whether the code is "
"well formed. This stage is responsible for generating most of the compiler "
"warnings as well as parse errors. The output of this stage is an \"Abstract "
"Syntax Tree\" (AST)."
