"The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes "
"facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), "
"loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source "
"locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support "
"Clang-based development tools. This C interface to Clang will never provide "
"all of the information representation stored in Clang's C++ AST, nor should "
"it: the intent is to maintain an API that is :ref:`relatively stable "
"<Stability>` from one release to the next, providing only the basic "
"functionality needed to support development tools. The entire C interface of "
"libclang is available in the file `Index.h`_"
