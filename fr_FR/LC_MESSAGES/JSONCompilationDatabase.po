"Tools based on the C++ Abstract Syntax Tree need full information how to "
"parse a translation unit. Usually this information is implicitly available "
"in the build system, but running tools as part of the build system is not "
"necessarily the best solution:"
msgstr ""

"Build systems are inherently change driven, so running multiple tools over "
"the same code base without changing the code does not fit into the "
"architecture of many build systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:19
msgid ""
"Figuring out whether things have changed is often an IO bound process; this "
"makes it hard to build low latency end user tools based on the build system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:22
msgid ""
"Build systems are inherently sequential in the build graph, for example due "
"to generated source code. While tools that run independently of the build "
"still need the generated source code to exist, running tools multiple times "
"over unchanging source does not require serialization of the runs according "
"to the build dependency graph."

"Clang has the ability to generate compilation database fragments via ``-MJ "

"`Bazel <https://bazel.build>`_ can export a compilation database via `this "

"A compilation database is a JSON file, which consist of an array of "
"\"command objects\", where each command object specifies one way a "
"translation unit is compiled in the project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:61
msgid ""
"Each command object contains the translation unit's main file, the working "
"directory of the compile run and the actual compile command."

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:119
msgid "Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:80
msgid "The contracts for each field in the command object are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:82
msgid ""
"**directory:** The working directory of the compilation. All paths specified "
"in the **command** or **file** fields must be either absolute or relative to "
"this directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:85
msgid ""
"**file:** The main translation unit source processed by this compilation "
"step. This is used by tools as the key into the compilation database. There "
"can be multiple command objects for the same file, for example if the same "
"source file is compiled with different configurations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:90
msgid ""
"**arguments:** The compile command argv as list of strings. This should run "
"the compilation step for the translation unit ``file``. ``arguments[0]`` "
"should be the executable name, such as ``clang++``. Arguments should not be "
"escaped, but ready to pass to ``execvp()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:94
msgid ""
"**command:** The compile command as a single shell-escaped string. Arguments "
"may be shell quoted and escaped following platform conventions, with "
"'``\"``' and '``\\``' being the only special characters. Shell expansion is "
"not supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:99
msgid ""
"Either **arguments** or **command** is required. **arguments** is preferred, "
"as shell (un)escaping is a possible source of errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:101
msgid ""
"**output:** The name of the output created by this compilation step. This "
"field is optional. It can be used to distinguish different processing modes "
"of the same input file."

"The convention is to name the file compile\\_commands.json and put it at the "
"top of the build directory. Clang tools are pointed to the top of the build "

"For simple projects, Clang tools also recognize a ``compile_flags.txt`` "
"file. This should contain one argument per line. The same flags will be used "
"to compile any file."

#: ../../../JSONCompilationDatabase.rst:127
msgid ""
"Here ``-I libwidget/include`` is two arguments, and so becomes two lines. "
"Paths are relative to the directory containing ``compile_flags.txt``."
