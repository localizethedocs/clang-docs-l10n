"Clang is only one component in a complete tool chain for C family "
"programming languages. In order to assemble a complete toolchain, additional "
"tools and runtime libraries are required. Clang is designed to interoperate "
"with existing tools and libraries for its target platforms, and the LLVM "
"project provides alternatives for a number of these components."

"A complete compilation of C family programming languages typically involves "
"the following pipeline of tools, some of which are omitted in some "
"compilations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Toolchain.rst:39
msgid ""
"**Preprocessor**: This performs the actions of the C preprocessor: expanding "
"#includes and #defines. The ``-E`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this "
"step."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Toolchain.rst:43
msgid ""
"**Parsing**: This parses and semantically analyzes the source language and "
"builds a source-level intermediate representation (\"AST\"), producing a :"
"ref:`precompiled header (PCH) <usersmanual-precompiled-headers>`, preamble, "
"or :doc:`precompiled module file (PCM) <Modules>`, depending on the input. "
"The ``-precompile`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. This is "
"the default when the input is a header file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Toolchain.rst:52
msgid ""
"**IR generation**: This converts the source-level intermediate "
"representation into an optimizer-specific intermediate representation (IR); "
"for Clang, this is LLVM IR. The ``-emit-llvm`` flag instructs Clang to stop "
"after this step. If combined with ``-S``, Clang will produce textual LLVM "
"IR; otherwise, it will produce LLVM IR bitcode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Toolchain.rst:59

"**Compiler backend**: This converts the intermediate representation into "
"target-specific assembly code. The ``-S`` flag instructs Clang to stop after "
"this step."

"**Linker**: This combines multiple object files into a single image (either "
"a shared object or an executable)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Toolchain.rst:70

"Clang provides all of these pieces other than the linker. When multiple "
