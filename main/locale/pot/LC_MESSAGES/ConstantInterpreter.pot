#: ../../../ConstantInterpreter.rst:21
msgid ""
"Bytecode compilation is handled in ``Compiler.h`` for statements and for "
"expressions. The compiler has two different backends: one to generate "
"bytecode for functions (``ByteCodeEmitter``) and one to directly evaluate "
"expressions as they are compiled, without generating bytecode "
"(``EvalEmitter``). All functions are compiled to bytecode, while toplevel "
"expressions used in constant contexts are directly evaluated since the "
"bytecode would never be reused. This mechanism aims to pave the way towards "
"replacing the evaluator, improving its performance on functions and loops, "
"while being just as fast on single-use toplevel expressions."

"The interpreter relies on stack-based, strongly-typed opcodes. The glue "
"logic between the code generator, along with the enumeration and description "
"of opcodes, can be found in ``Opcodes.td``. The opcodes are implemented as "
"generic template methods in ``Interp.h`` and instantiated with the relevant "
"primitive types by the interpreter loop or by the evaluating emitter."

"Bytecode is executed using a stack-based interpreter. The execution context "

"Memory management in the interpreter relies on 3 data structures: ``Block`` "

msgstr ""

msgid "Blocks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ConstantInterpreter.rst:116
msgid ""
"Blocks contain data interleaved with metadata. They are allocated either "
"statically in the code generator (globals, static members, dummy parameter "
"values etc.) or dynamically in the interpreter, when creating the frame "
"containing the local variables of a function. Blocks are associated with a "
"descriptor that characterises the entire allocation, along with a few "

#: ../../../ConstantInterpreter.rst:130
msgid ""
"Static blocks are never deallocated, but local ones might be deallocated "
"even when there are live pointers to them. Pointers are only valid as long "
"as the blocks they point to are valid, so a block with pointers to it whose "
"lifetime ends is kept alive until all pointers to it go out of scope. Since "
"the frame is destroyed on function exit, such blocks are turned into a "
"``DeadBlock`` and copied to storage managed by the interpreter itself, not "
"the frame. Reads and writes to these blocks are illegal and cause an "
"appropriate diagnostic to be emitted. When the last pointer goes out of "
"scope, dead blocks are also deallocated."
