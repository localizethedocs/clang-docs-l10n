"Normally, static analysis works in the boundary of one translation unit "
"(TU). However, with additional steps and configuration we can enable the "
"analysis to inline the definition of a function from another TU."

"CTU analysis can be used in a variety of ways. The importing of external TU "
"definitions can work with pre-dumped PCH files or generating the necessary "
"AST structure on-demand, during the analysis of the main TU. Driving the "
"static analysis can also be implemented in multiple ways. The most direct "
"way is to specify the necessary commandline options of the Clang frontend "
"manually (and generate the prerequisite dependencies of the specific import "
"method by hand). This process can be automated by other tools, like "
"`CodeChecker <https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker>`_ and scan-build-py "
"(preference for the former)."

"The analysis needs the PCH dumps of all the translations units used in the "
"project. These can be generated by the Clang Frontend itself, and must be "
"arranged in a specific way in the filesystem. The index, which maps symbols' "
"USR names to PCH dumps containing them must also be generated by the `clang-"
"extdef-mapping`. Entries in the index *must* have an `.ast` suffix if the "
"goal is to use PCH-based analysis, as the lack of that extension signals "
"that the entry is to be used as a source-file, and parsed on-demand. This "
"tool uses a :doc:`compilation database <../../JSONCompilationDatabase>` to "
"determine the compilation flags used. The analysis invocation must be "
"provided with the directory which contains the dumps and the mapping files."
