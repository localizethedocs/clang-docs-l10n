"The open sourcing to llvm.org's ``llvm-project`` is still on going and the "

"is available `here <https://github.com/swiftlang/llvm-project/tree/"

"Pass ``-fbounds-safety`` as a Clang compilation flag for the C file that you "
"want to adopt. We recommend adopting the model file by file, because "
"adoption requires some effort to add bounds annotations and fix compiler "
"diagnostics."

"``ptrcheck.h`` is a Clang toolchain header to provide definition of the "
"bounds annotations such as ``__counted_by``, ``__counted_by_or_null``, "
"``__sized_by``, etc. In the LLVM source tree, the header is located in "
"``llvm-project/clang/lib/Headers/ptrcheck.h``."

"Annotate pointers on struct fields and function parameters if they are "
"pointing to an array of object, with appropriate bounds annotations. Please "
"see :doc:`BoundsSafety` to learn what kind of bounds annotations are "
"available and their semantics. Note that local pointer variables typically "
"don't need bounds annotations because they are implicitly a wide pointer "
"(``__bidi_indexable``) that automatically carries the bounds information."

"Once you pass ``-fbounds-safety`` to compiler a C file, you will see some "
"new compiler warnings and errors, which guide adoption of ``-fbounds-"
"safety``. Consider the following example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../BoundsSafetyAdoptionGuide.rst:61
msgid ""
"The parameter ``int *p`` doesn't have a bounds annotation, so the compiler "
"will complain about the code indexing into it (``p[i]``) as it assumes that "
"``p`` is pointing to a single ``int`` object or null. To address the "
"diagnostics, you should add a bounds annotation on ``int *p`` so that the "
"compiler can reason about the safety of the array subscript. In the "
"following example, ``p`` is now ``int *__counted_by(n)``, so the compiler "
"will allow the array subscript with additional run-time checks as necessary."

"Adopting ``-fbounds-safety`` may cause your program to trap if it violates "
