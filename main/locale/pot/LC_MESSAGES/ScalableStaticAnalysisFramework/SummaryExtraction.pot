"The simplest way to think about the lifetime of a summary extraction is by "
"following the handlers of the ``FrontendAction`` implementing it. There are "
"3 APIs that are important for us, that are invoked in this order:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ScalableStaticAnalysisFramework/SummaryExtraction.rst:13

"``BeginInvocation()``: Checks the command-line arguments related to summary "
"extraction."

"The framework uses `llvm::Registry\\<\\> <https://llvm.org/doxygen/"
"classllvm_1_1Registry.html>`_ as an extension point for adding new summary "
"analyses or serialization formats. Each entry in the *registry* holds a "
"name, a description and a pointer to a constructor."

"Decentralizes the registration. There is not a single place in the source "
"code where we spell out all of the analyses/formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ScalableStaticAnalysisFramework/SummaryExtraction.rst:30
msgid ""
"Plays nicely with downstream extensibility, as downstream users can add "
"their own analyses/formats without touching the source code of the "
"framework; while still benefiting from the upstream-provided analyses/"
"formats."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../ScalableStaticAnalysisFramework/SummaryExtraction.rst:35

"Registration slows down all ``clang`` users by a tiny amount, even if they "
"don't invoke the summary extraction framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ScalableStaticAnalysisFramework/SummaryExtraction.rst:36
msgid ""
"As the registration is now decoupled, it's now a global program property; "
"and potentially more difficult to reason about."

"Remember, we pass a mutable ``TUSummaryBuilder`` reference to the "
