"**Clang-Repl** is an interactive C++ interpreter that allows for incremental "
"compilation. It supports interactive programming for C++ in a read-evaluate-"
"print-loop (REPL) style. It uses Clang as a library to compile the high "
"level programming language into LLVM IR. Then the LLVM IR is executed by the "
"LLVM just-in-time (JIT) infrastructure."

"The Value object is essentially used to create a mapping between an "
"expression 'type' and the allocated 'memory'. Built-in types (bool, char, "
"int, float, double, etc.) are copyable. Their memory allocation size is "
"known and the Value object can introduce a small-buffer optimization. In "

"management."

"The implementation maps the type as written and the Clang Type to be able to "
"use the preprocessor to synthesize the relevant cast operations. For "
"example, ``X(char, Char_S)``, where ``char`` is the type from the language's "
"type system and ``Char_S`` is the Clang builtin type which represents it. "
"This mapping helps to import execution results from the interpreter in a "

"at runtime and this is why it has a very low token count and was developed "
"with strict constraints in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This also enables the user to receive the computed 'type' back in their code "

"a float). Normally, the compiler can handle these conversions transparently, "
"but in interpreter mode, the compiler cannot see all the 'from' and 'to' "

"providing these conversions on request."
