"Warning suppression mappings enable users to suppress Clang's diagnostics at "
"a per-file granularity. This allows enforcing diagnostics in specific parts "
"of the project even if there are violations in some headers."

msgid "Goal and usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../WarningSuppressionMappings.rst:18
msgid ""
"Clang allows diagnostics to be configured at a translation-unit granularity. "
"If a ``foo.cpp`` is compiled with ``-Wfoo``, all transitively included "
"headers also need to be clean. Hence, turning on new warnings in large "
"codebases requires cleaning up all the existing warnings. This might not be "
"possible when some dependencies aren't in the project owner's control or "
"because new violations are creeping up quicker than the clean up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../WarningSuppressionMappings.rst:25
msgid ""
"Warning suppression mappings aim to alleviate some of these concerns by "
"making diagnostic configuration granularity finer, at a source file level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../WarningSuppressionMappings.rst:28
msgid ""
"To achieve this, user can create a file that lists which :doc:`diagnostic "
"groups <DiagnosticsReference>` to suppress in which files or paths, and pass "
"it as a command line argument to Clang with the ``--warning-suppression-"
"mappings`` flag."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../WarningSuppressionMappings.rst:33
msgid ""
"Note that this mechanism won't enable any diagnostics on its own. Users "
"should still turn on warnings in their compilations with explicit ``-Wfoo`` "
"flags. `Controlling diagnostics pragmas <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/"
"UsersManual.html#controlling-diagnostics-via-pragmas>`_ take precedence over "
"suppression mappings. Ensuring code author's explicit intent is always "
"preserved."

"Sections describe which diagnostic group's behaviour to change, e.g. "
"``[unused]``. When a diagnostic is matched by multiple sections, the latest "
"section takes precedence."

#: ../../../WarningSuppressionMappings.rst:70
msgid ""
"Afterwards in each section, users can have multiple entities that match "
"source files based on the globs. These entities look like ``src:*/my/dir/"
"*``. Users can also use the ``emit`` category to exclude a subdirectory from "
"suppression. Source files are matched against these globs either:"
