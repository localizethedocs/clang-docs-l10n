"**Strict mode** - compiler emits an error when an unavailable API is found "

"In order to encode API availability based on the shader model version and "

"Clang ``availability`` attribute."

#: ../../../HLSL/AvailabilityDiagnostics.rst:29

"``Sema::ActOnEndOfTranslationUnit``). The implementation iterates over all "
"shader entry points and exported library functions in the translation unit "
"and performs an AST traversal of each function body."

msgid ""
"When a reference to another function or member method is found "
"(``DeclRefExpr`` or ``MemberExpr``) and it has a body, the AST of the "
"referenced function is also scanned. This chain of AST traversals will reach "
"all of the code that is reachable from the initial shader entry point or "
"exported library function and avoids the need to generate a call graph."

"All shader APIs have an availability attribute that specifies the shader "
"model version (and environment, if applicable) when this API was first "
"introduced.When a reference to a function without a definition is found and "
"it has an availability attribute, the version of the attribute is checked "
"against the target shader model version and shader stage (if shader stage "
"context is known), and an appropriate diagnostic is generated as needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/AvailabilityDiagnostics.rst:40
msgid ""
"All shader entry functions have ``HLSLShaderAttr`` attribute that specifies "
"what type of shader this function represents. However, for exported library "
"functions the target shader stage is unknown, so in this case the HLSL API "
"availability will be only checked against the shader model version. It means "
"that for exported library functions the diagnostic of APIs with availability "
"specific to shader stage will be deferred until DXIL linking time."

"A list of functions that were already scanned is kept in order to avoid "
"duplicate scans and diagnostics (see ``DiagnoseHLSLAvailability::"
"ScannedDecls``). It might happen that a shader library has multiple shader "
"entry points for different shader stages that all call into the same shared "
"function. It is therefore important to record not just that a function has "
"been scanned, but also in which shader stage context. This is done by using "
"``llvm::DenseMap`` that maps ``FunctionDecl *`` to a ``unsigned`` bitmap "
"that represents a set of shader stages (or environments) the function has "
"been scanned for. The ``N``'th bit in the set is set if the function has "
"been scanned in shader environment whose ``HLSLShaderAttr::ShaderType`` "
"integer value equals ``N``."

"The emitted diagnostic messages belong to ``hlsl-availability`` diagnostic "

msgid "Strict Diagnostic Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/AvailabilityDiagnostics.rst:49
msgid ""
"When strict HLSL availability diagnostic mode is enabled the compiler must "
"report all HLSL API availability issues regardless of code reachability. The "
"implementation of this mode takes advantage of an existing diagnostic scan "
"in ``DiagnoseUnguardedAvailability`` class which is already traversing AST "
"of each function as soon as the function body has been parsed. For HLSL, "
"this pass was only slightly modified, such as making sure diagnostic "
"messages are in the ``hlsl-availability`` group and that availability checks "
"based on shader stage are not included if the shader stage context is "
"unknown."

#: ../../../HLSL/AvailabilityDiagnostics.rst:51
msgid ""
"If the compilation target is a shader library, only availability based on "
"shader model version can be diagnosed during this scan. To diagnose "
"availability based on shader stage, the compiler needs to run the AST "
"traversals implemented in ``DiagnoseHLSLAvailability`` at the end of the "
"translation unit as described above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../HLSL/AvailabilityDiagnostics.rst:53
msgid ""
"As a result, availability based on specific shader stage will only be "
"diagnosed in code that is reachable from a shader entry point or library "
"export function. It also means that function bodies might be scanned "
"multiple time. When that happens, care should be taken not to produce "
"duplicated diagnostics."
