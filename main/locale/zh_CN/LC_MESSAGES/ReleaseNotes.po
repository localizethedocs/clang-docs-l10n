"Clang will now emit a warning if the auto-detected GCC installation "
"directory (i.e. the one with the largest version number) does not contain "
"libstdc++ include directories although a \"complete\" GCC installation "
"directory containing the include directories is available. It is planned to "
"change the auto-detection to prefer the \"complete\" directory in the "
"future.  The warning will disappear if the libstdc++ include directories are "
"either installed or removed for all GCC installation directories considered "
"by the auto-detection; see the output of ``clang -v`` for a list of those "
"directories. If the GCC installations cannot be modified and maintaining the "
"current choice of the auto-detection is desired, the GCC installation "
"directory can be selected explicitly using the ``--gcc-install-dir`` command "
"line argument. This will silence the warning. It can also be disabled using "

"Scalar deleting destructor support has been aligned with MSVC when targeting "
"the MSVC ABI. Clang previously implemented support for ``::delete`` by "
"calling the complete object destructor and then the appropriate global "
"delete operator (as is done for the Itanium ABI). The scalar deleting "
"destructor is now called to destroy the object and deallocate its storage. "
"This is an ABI change that can result in memory corruption when a program "
"built for the MSVC ABI has portions compiled with clang 21 or earlier and "
"portions compiled with a version of clang 22 (or MSVC). Consider a class "
"``X`` that declares a virtual destructor and an ``operator delete`` member "
"with the destructor defined in library ``A`` and a call to `::delete`` in "
"library ``B``. If library ``A`` is compiled with clang 21 and library ``B`` "
"is compiled with clang 22, the ``::delete`` call might dispatch to the "
"scalar deleting destructor emitted in library ``A`` which will erroneously "
"call the member ``operator delete`` instead of the expected global delete "
"operator. The old behavior is retained under ``-fclang-abi-compat=21`` flag."

"Trapping UBSan (e.g. ``-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize-trap=undefined``) now "
"emits a string describing the reason for trapping into the generated debug "
"info. This feature allows debuggers (e.g. LLDB) to display the reason for "
"trapping if the trap is reached. The string is currently encoded in the "
"debug info as an artificial frame that claims to be inlined at the trap "
"location. The function used for the artificial frame is an artificial "
"function whose name encodes the reason for trapping. The encoding used is "
"currently the same as ``__builtin_verbose_trap`` but might change in the "
"future. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by compiling "
"with ``-fno-sanitize-debug-trap-reasons``. The feature has a ``basic`` and "
"``detailed`` mode (the default). The ``basic`` mode emits a hard-coded "
"string per trap kind (e.g. ``Integer addition overflowed``) and the "
"``detailed`` mode emits a more descriptive string describing each individual "
"trap (e.g. ``signed integer addition overflow in 'a + b'``). The "
"``detailed`` mode produces larger debug info than ``basic`` but is more "
"helpful for debugging. The ``-fsanitize-debug-trap-reasons=`` flag can be "
"used to switch between the different modes or disable the feature entirely. "
"Note due to trap merging in optimized builds (i.e. in each function all "
"traps of the same kind get merged into the same trap instruction) the trap "
