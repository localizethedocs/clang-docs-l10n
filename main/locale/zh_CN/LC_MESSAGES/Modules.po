"Most software is built using a number of software libraries, including "
"libraries supplied by the platform, internal libraries built as part of the "
"software itself to provide structure, and third-party libraries. For each "
"library, one needs to access both its interface (API) and its "
"implementation. In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is "
"accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:16
msgid ""
"The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate "
"library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that "
"provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems "
"inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library."

msgid ""
"The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way "
"to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:24
msgid ""
"**Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the compiler "
"must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every header it "
"includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for every translation "
"unit in the application, which involves a huge amount of redundant work. In "
"a project with *N* translation units and *M* headers included in each "
"translation unit, the compiler is performing *M x N* work even though most "
"of the *M* headers are shared among multiple translation units. C++ is "
"particularly bad, because the compilation model for templates forces a huge "
"amount of code into headers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:35
msgid ""
"**Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual inclusion by "
"the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any active macro definitions "
"at the time of inclusion. If any of the active macro definitions happens to "
"collide with a name in the library, it can break the library API or cause "
"compilation failures in the library header itself. For an extreme example, "
"``#define std \"The C++ Standard\"`` and then include a standard library "
"header: the result is a horrific cascade of failures in the C++ Standard "
"Library's implementation. More subtle real-world problems occur when the "
"headers for two different libraries interact due to macro collisions, and "
"users are forced to reorder ``#include`` directives or introduce ``#undef`` "
"directives to break the (unintended) dependency."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Conventional workarounds**: C programmers have adopted a number of "
"conventions to work around the fragility of the C preprocessor model. "
"Include guards, for example, are required for the vast majority of headers "
"to ensure that multiple inclusion doesn't break the compile. Macro names are "
"written with ``LONG_PREFIXED_UPPERCASE_IDENTIFIERS`` to avoid collisions, "
"and some library/framework developers even use ``__underscored`` names in "
"headers to avoid collisions with \"normal\" names that (by convention) "
"shouldn't even be macros. These conventions are a barrier to entry for "
"developers coming from non-C languages, are boilerplate for more experienced "
"developers, and make our headers far uglier than they should be."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:62
msgid ""
"**Tool confusion**: In a C-based language, it is hard to build tools that "
"work well with software libraries, because the boundaries of the libraries "
"are not clear. Which headers belong to a particular library, and in what "
"order should those headers be included to guarantee that they compile "
"correctly? Are the headers C, C++, Objective-C++, or one of the variants of "
"these languages? What declarations in those headers are actually meant to be "
"part of the API, and what declarations are present only because they had to "
"be written as part of the header file?"

msgid ""
"Modules improve access to the API of software libraries by replacing the "
"textual preprocessor inclusion model with a more robust, more efficient "
"semantic model. From the user's perspective, the code looks only slightly "
"different, because one uses an ``import`` declaration rather than a "
"``#include`` preprocessor directive:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:80
msgid ""
"However, this module import behaves quite differently from the corresponding "
"``#include <stdio.h>``: when the compiler sees the module import above, it "
"loads a binary representation of the ``std.io`` module and makes its API "
"available to the application directly. Preprocessor definitions that precede "
"the import declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, "
"because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. "
"Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will "
"automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_ This semantic "
"import model addresses many of the problems of the preprocessor inclusion "
"model:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:83
msgid ""
"**Compile-time scalability**: The ``std.io`` module is only compiled once, "
"and importing the module into a translation unit is a constant-time "
"operation (independent of module system). Thus, the API of each software "
"library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an "
"*M + N* problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:85
msgid ""
"**Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a "
"consistent preprocessor environment. This completely eliminates the need for "
"``__underscored`` names and similarly defensive tricks. Moreover, the "
"current preprocessor definitions when an import declaration is encountered "
"are ignored, so one software library can not affect how another software "
"library is compiled, eliminating include-order dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:87
msgid ""
"**Tool confusion**: Modules describe the API of software libraries, and "
"tools can reason about and present a module as a representation of that API. "
"Because modules can only be built standalone, tools can rely on the module "
"definition to ensure that they get the complete API for the library. "
"Moreover, modules can specify which languages they work with, so, e.g., one "
"can not accidentally attempt to load a C++ module into a C program."

"**Rewrite the world's code**: It is not realistic to require applications or "
"software libraries to make drastic or non-backward-compatible changes, nor "

"with existing software libraries and allow a gradual transition."

"must still rely on the existing versioning mechanisms of the underlying "
"language (if any exist) to version software libraries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:97
msgid ""
"**Namespaces**: Unlike in some languages, modules do not imply any notion of "
"namespaces. Thus, a struct declared in one module will still conflict with a "
"struct of the same name declared in a different module, just as they would "
"if declared in two different headers. This aspect is important for backward "
"compatibility, because (for example) the mangled names of entities in "
"software libraries must not change when introducing modules."

"The primary user-level feature of modules is the import operation, which "

"``#include`` directives into the corresponding module import. For example, "
"the include directive"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:138
msgid ""
"will be automatically mapped to an import of the module ``std.io``. Even "
"with specific ``import`` syntax in the language, this particular feature is "
"important for both adoption and backward compatibility: automatic "
"translation of ``#include`` to ``import`` allows an application to get the "
"benefits of modules (for all modules-enabled libraries) without any changes "
"to the application itself. Thus, users can easily use modules with one "
"compiler while falling back to the preprocessor-inclusion mechanism with "
"other compilers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:142
msgid ""
"The automatic mapping of ``#include`` to ``import`` also solves an "
"implementation problem: importing a module with a definition of some entity "
"(say, a ``struct Point``) and then parsing a header containing another "
"definition of ``struct Point`` would cause a redefinition error, even if it "
"is the same ``struct Point``. By mapping ``#include`` to ``import``, the "

"While building a module, ``#include_next`` is also supported, with one "

"*after* the one in which the current file was found. Because files listed in "
"module maps are not found through include paths, a different strategy is "
"used for ``#include_next`` directives in such files: the list of include "
"paths is searched for the specified header name, to find the first include "
"path that would refer to the current file. ``#include_next`` is interpreted "
"as if the current file had been found in that path. If this search finds a "
"file named by a module map, the ``#include_next`` directive is translated "

#: ../../../Modules.rst:159
msgid ""
"The crucial link between modules and headers is described by a *module map*, "
"which describes how a collection of existing headers maps on to the "
"(logical) structure of a module. For example, one could imagine a module "
"``std`` covering the C standard library. Each of the C standard library "
"headers (``<stdio.h>``, ``<stdlib.h>``, ``<math.h>``, etc.) would contribute "
"to the ``std`` module, by placing their respective APIs into the "
"corresponding submodule (``std.io``, ``std.lib``, ``std.math``, etc.). "
"Having a list of the headers that are part of the ``std`` module allows the "
"compiler to build the ``std`` module as a standalone entity, and having the "
"mapping from header names to (sub)modules allows the automatic translation "
"of ``#include`` directives to module imports."

"System headers vend core types such as ``size_t`` for users. These types are "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../Modules.rst:1093
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, when modules compiles all of the C library headers together "

"will be visible, and then only in the submodule corresponding to the lucky "
"first header. Any other headers that have copy-and-pasted versions of this "
"pattern will *not* have a definition of ``size_t``. Importing the submodule "
"corresponding to one of those headers will therefore not yield ``size_t`` as "
"part of the API, because it wasn't there when the header was parsed. The fix "
"for this problem is either to pull the copied declarations into a common "
"header that gets included everywhere ``size_t`` is part of the API, or to "
"eliminate the ``#ifndef`` and redefine the ``size_t`` type. The latter works "
