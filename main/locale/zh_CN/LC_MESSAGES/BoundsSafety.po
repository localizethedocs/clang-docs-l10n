"compiler employs compile-time restrictions and emits run-time checks as "
"necessary to ensure the new count value doesn't exceed the actual length of "
"the buffer. Section `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_ "

"The requirement to annotate all pointers with explicit bounds information "
"could present a significant adoption burden. To tackle this issue, the model "

"Utilizing wide pointers can potentially reduce the adoption burden, as it "
"contains bounds information internally and eliminates the need for explicit "
"bounds annotations. However, wide pointers differ from standard C pointers "

"The C language allows pointer arithmetic on arbitrary pointers and this has "
"been a source of many bounds safety issues. In practice, many pointers are "
"merely pointing to a single object and incrementing or decrementing such a "
"pointer immediately makes the pointer go out-of-bounds. To prevent this "

"``__single`` is the default annotation for ABI-visible pointers. This gives "

"error when a ``__single`` pointer is utilized for pointer arithmetic or "
"array access, as these operations would immediately cause the pointer to "
"exceed its bounds. Consequently, this prompts programmers to provide "
"sufficient bounds information to pointers. In the following example, the "
"pointer on parameter p is single-by-default, and is employed for array "
"access. As a result, the compiler generates an error suggesting to add "
