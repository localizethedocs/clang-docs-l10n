"This document describes the general approach to code duplication in the "
"ClangIR code generation implementation. It acknowledges specific problems "
"with the current implementation, discusses strategies for mitigating the "
"risk inherent in the current approach, and describes a general long-term "
"plan for addressing the issue."

msgid ""
"The ClangIR code generation is very closely modeled after Clang's LLVM IR "
"code generation, and we intend for the CIR produced to eventually be "
"semantically equivalent to the LLVM IR produced when not going through "
"ClangIR. However, we acknowledge that as the ClangIR implementation is under "
"development, there will be differences in semantics, both because we have "
"not yet implemented all features of the classic codegen and because the CIR "
"dialect is still evolving and does not yet have a way to represent all of "
"the necessary semantics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:28
msgid ""
"We have chosen to model the ClangIR code generation directly after the "
"classic codegen, to the point of following identical code structure, using "
"similar names and often duplicating the logic because this seemed to be the "
"most certain path to producing equivalent results. Having such nearly "
"identical code allows for direct comparison between the CIR codegen and the "
"LLVM IR codegen to find what is missing or incorrect in the CIR "
"implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:35
msgid ""
"However, we recognize that this is not a sustainable permanent solution. As "
"bugs are fixed and new features are added to the classic codegen, the "
"process of keeping the analogous CIR code up to date will be a purely manual "
"process."

msgid "Current Strategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:44
msgid ""
"Practical considerations require that we make steady progress towards a "
"working implementation of ClangIR. This necessity is directly opposed to the "
"goal of minimizing code duplication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:48
msgid ""
"For this reason, we have decided to accept a large amount of code "
"duplication in the short term, even with the explicit understanding that "
"this is producing a significant amount of technical debt as the project "
"progresses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:52
msgid ""
"As the CIR implementation is developed, we often note small pieces of code "
"that could be shared with the classic codegen if they were moved to a "
"different part of the source, such as a shared utility class in some "
"directory available to both codegen implementations or by moving the "
"function into a related AST class. It is left to the discretion of the "
"developer and reviewers to decide whether such refactoring should be done "
"during the CIR development, or if it is sufficient to leave a comment in the "
"code indicating this as an opportunity for future improvement. Because much "
"of the current code is likely to change when the long term code sharing "
"strategy is complete, we will lean towards only implementing refactorings "
"that make sense independent of the code sharing problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:64
msgid ""
"We have discussed various ways that major classes such as CGCXXABI/"
"CIRGenCXXABI could be refactored to allow parts of there implementation to "
"be shared today through inheritence and templated base classes. However, "
"this may prove to be wasted effort when the permanent solution is developed. "
"Also, deferring this kind of intertwined implementation prevents introducing "
"cross-dependencies that would make it more difficult to remove one IR code "
"generation implementation without degrading the quality of the other. "
"Therefore, we have decided that it is better to accept significant amounts "
"of code duplication now, and defer this type of refactoring until it is "
"clear what the permanent solution will be."

msgid "Mitigation Through Testing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:77
msgid ""
"The most important tactic that we are using to mitigate the risk of CIR "
"diverging from classic codegen is to incorporate two sets of LLVM IR checks "
"in the CIR codegen LIT tests. One set checks the LLVM IR that is produced by "
"first generating CIR and then lowering that to LLVM IR. Another set checks "
"the LLVM IR that is produced directly by the classic codegen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:83
msgid ""
"At the time that tests are created, we compare the LLVM IR output from these "
"two paths to verify (manually) that any meaningful differences between them "
"are the result of known missing features in the current CIR implementation. "
"Whenever possible, differences are corrected in the same PR that the test is "
"being added, updating the CIR implementation as it is being developed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:89
msgid ""
"However, these tests serve a second purpose. They also serve as sentinels to "
"alert us to changes in the classic codegen behavior that will need to be "
"accounted for in the CIR implementation. While we appreciate any help from "
"developers contributing to classic codegen, our current expectation is that "
"it will be the responsibility of the ClangIR contributors to update the CIR "
"implementation when these tests fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:96
msgid ""
"As the CIR implementation gets closer to the goal of IR that is semantically "
"equivalent to the LLVM IR produced by the classic codegen, we would like to "
"enhance the CIR tests to perform some automatic verification of the "
"equivalence of the generated LLVM IR, perhaps using a combination of tools "
"such as `opt -pass-normalize` and Alive2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:102
msgid ""
"Eventually, we would like to be able to run all existing classic codegen "
"tests using the CIR path as well."

msgid "Other Considerations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:108
msgid ""
"The close modeling of CIR after classic codegen has also meant that the CIR "
"dialect often represents language details at a much lower level than it "
"ideally should."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:112
msgid ""
"In the interest of having a complete working implementation of ClangIR as "
"soon as is practical, we have chosen to take the approach of following the "
"classic codegen implementation closely in the initial implementation and "
"only raising the representation in the CIR dialect to a higher level when "
"there is a clear and immediate benefit to doing so."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:118
msgid ""
"Over time, we expect to progressively raise the CIR representation to a "
"higher level and remove low level details, including ABI-specific handling "
"from the dialect. (See the \"Long Term Vision\" section below for more  "
"details.) Having a working implementation in place makes it easier to verify "
"that the high-level representation and subsequent lowering are correct."

msgid "Mixing With Other Dialects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:127
msgid ""
"Mixing of dialects is a central design feature of MLIR. The CIR dialect is "
"currently more self-contained than most dialects, but even now we generate "
"the ACC (OpenACCC) dialect in combination with CIR, and when support for "
"OpenMP and CUDA are added, similar mixing will occur."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:132
msgid ""
"We also expect CIR to be at least partially lowered to other dialects during "
"the optimization phase to enable features such as data dependence analysis, "
"even if we will eventually be lowering it to LLVM IR."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:136
msgid ""
"Therefore, any plan for generating LLVM IR from CIR must be integrated with "
"the general MLIR lowering design, which typically involves lowering to the "
"LLVM dialect, which is then transformed to LLVM IR."

msgid "Other Consumers of CIR and MLIR"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:143
msgid ""
"We must also consider that we will not always be lowering CIR to LLVM IR. "
"CIR, usually mixed with other dialects, will also be directed to offload "
"targets and other code generators through interfaces that are opaque to "
"Clang, such as SPIR-V and MLIR core dialects. We must still produce "
"semantically correct CIR for these consumers."

msgid "Long Term Vision"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:152
msgid ""
"As the CIR implementation matures, we will eliminate target-specific "
"handling from the high-level CIR generated by Clang. The high-level CIR will "
"then be progressively lowered to a form that is closer to LLVM IR, including "
"a pass that inserts ABI-specific handling, potentially representing the "
"target-specific details in another dialect. More complex transformations, "
"such as library-aware idiom recognition or advanced loop representations—may "
"occur later in the compilation pipeline through additional passes, which can "
"be controlled by specific compiler flags."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:161
msgid ""
"As we raise CIR to this higher level implementation, there will naturally be "
"less code duplication, and less need to have the same logic repeated in the "
"CIR generation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:165
msgid ""
"We will continue to use that same basic design and structure for CIR code "
"generation, with classes like CIRGenModule and CIRGenFunction that serve the "
"same purpose as their counterparts in classic codegen, but the handling "
"there will be more closely tied to core semantics and therefore less likely "
"to require frequent changes to stay in sync with classic codegen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:171
msgid ""
"As the handling of low-level details is moved to later lowering phases, we "
"will need to move away from the current tight coupling of the CIR and "
"classic codegen implementations. As this happens, we will look for ways that "
"this handling can be moved to new classes that are specifically designed to "
"be shared among clients that are targeting different IR substrates. That is, "
"rather than trying to overlay reuse onto the existing implementations, we "
"will replace relevant parts of the existing implementation, piece by piece, "
"as appropriate, with new implementations that perform the same function but "
"with a more general design."

msgid "Example: C Calling Convention Handling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:183
msgid ""
"C calling convention handling is an example of a general purpose redesign "
"that is already underway. This was started independently of CIR, but it will "
"be directly useful for lowering from high-level call representation in CIR "
"to a representation that includes the target- and calling convention-"
"specific details of function signatures, parameter type coercion, and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:189
msgid ""
"The current CIR implementation duplicates most of the classic codegen "
"handling for function call handling, but it omits several pieces that handle "
"type coercion. This leads to an implementation that has all of the "
"complexity of the class codegen without actually achieving the goals of that "
"complexity. It will be a significant improvement to the CIR implementation "
"to simplify the function call handling in such a way that it generates a "
"high-level representation of the call, while preserving all information that "
"will be needed to lower the call to an ABI-compliant representation in a "
"later phase of compilation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:198
msgid ""
"This provides a clear example where trying to refactor the classic codegen "
"in some way to be reused by CIR would have been counterproductive. The "
"classic codegen implementation was tightly coupled with Clang's LLVM IR "
"generation. The implementation is being completely redesigned to allow "
"general reuse, not just by CIR, but also by other front ends."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangIRCodeDuplication.rst:204
msgid ""
"The CIR calling convention lowering will make use of the general purpose C "
"calling convention library that is being created, but it should create an "
"MLIR transform pass on top of that library that is general enough to be used "
"by other dialects, such as FIR, that also need the same calling convention "
"handling."
