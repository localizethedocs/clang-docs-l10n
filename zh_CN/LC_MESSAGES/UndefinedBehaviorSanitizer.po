msgid ""
"Use ``clang++`` to compile and link your program with the ``-"
"fsanitize=undefined`` option. Make sure to use ``clang++`` (not ``ld``) as a "
"linker, so that your executable is linked with proper UBSan runtime "
"libraries, unless all enabled checks use trap mode. You can use ``clang`` "
"instead of ``clang++`` if you're compiling/linking C code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst:53

"You can use ``-fsanitize=...`` and ``-fno-sanitize=`` to enable and disable "
