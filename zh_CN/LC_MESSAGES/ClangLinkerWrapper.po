"This tool works as a wrapper of the normal host linking job. This tool is "
"used to create linked device images for offloading and the necessary runtime "
"calls to register them. It works by first scanning the linker's input for "
"embedded device offloading data stored at the ``.llvm.offloading`` section. "
"This section contains binary data created by the :doc:"
"`ClangOffloadPackager`. The extracted device files will then be linked. The "
"linked modules will then be wrapped into a new object file containing the "
"code necessary to register it with the offloading runtime."

"This tool links object files with offloading images embedded within it using "
"the ``-fembed-offload-object`` flag in Clang. Given an input file containing "
"the magic section we can pass it to this tool to extract the data contained "
"at that section and run a device linking job on it."
