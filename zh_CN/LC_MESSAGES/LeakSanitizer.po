"LeakSanitizer is a run-time memory leak detector. It can be combined with :"
"doc:`AddressSanitizer` to get both memory error and leak detection, or used "
"in a stand-alone mode. LSan adds almost no performance overhead until the "
"very end of the process, at which point there is an extra leak detection "
"phase."

"To use LeakSanitizer in stand-alone mode, link your program with ``-"
"fsanitize=leak`` flag. Make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the link "
"step, so that it would link in proper LeakSanitizer run-time library into "
"the final executable."

"LeakSanitizer is a bug detection tool and its runtime is not meant to be "
"linked against production executables. While it may be useful for testing, "
"LeakSanitizer's runtime was not developed with security-sensitive "
"constraints in mind and may compromise the security of the resulting "
"executable."
