"ShadowCallStack is an instrumentation pass, currently only implemented for "
"aarch64 and RISC-V, that protects programs against return address overwrites "
"(e.g. stack buffer overflows.) It works by saving a function's return "
"address to a separately allocated 'shadow call stack' in the function prolog "
"in non-leaf functions and loading the return address from the shadow call "
"stack in the function epilog. The return address is also stored on the "
"regular stack for compatibility with unwinders, but is otherwise unused."

"The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and an "
"`implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc (bionic). "
"An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found to have "
"critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in LLVM 9.0. "
"Details on the x86_64 implementation can be found in the `Clang 7.0.1 "
"documentation`_."

"To optimize for memory consumption and cache locality, the shadow call stack "
"stores only an array of return addresses. This is in contrast to other "
"schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off "

"`Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks "

"Intel `Control-flow Enforcement Technology`_ (CET) is a proposed hardware "
"extension that would add native support to use a shadow stack to store/check "
"return addresses at call/return time. Being a hardware implementation, it "
"would not suffer from race conditions and would not incur the overhead of "
"function instrumentation, but it does require operating system support."

"The instrumentation makes use of the platform register ``x18`` on AArch64, "
"``x3`` (``gp``) on RISC-V with software shadow stack and ``ssp`` on RISC-V "
"with hardware shadow stack, which needs `Zicfiss`_ and ``-mno-forced-sw-"
"shadow-stack`` (default option). Note that with ``Zicfiss``_ the RISC-V "
"backend will default to the hardware based shadow call stack. Users can "
"force the RISC-V backend to generate the software shadow call stack with "
"``Zicfiss``_ by passing ``-mforced-sw-shadow-stack``. For simplicity we will "
"refer to this as the ``SCSReg``. On some platforms, ``SCSReg`` is reserved, "
"and on others, it is designated as a scratch register. This generally means "
"that any code that may run on the same thread as code compiled with "
"ShadowCallStack must either target one of the platforms whose ABI reserves "
"``SCSReg`` (currently Android, Darwin, Fuchsia and Windows) or be compiled "
"with a flag to reserve that register (e.g., ``-ffixed-x18``). If absolutely "
"necessary, code compiled without reserving the register may be run on the "
"same thread as code that uses ShadowCallStack by saving the register value "
"temporarily on the stack (`example in Android`_) but this should be done "
"with care since it risks leaking the shadow call stack address."

"Because it requires a dedicated register, the ShadowCallStack feature is "
"incompatible with any other feature that may use ``SCSReg``. However, there "
"is no inherent reason why ShadowCallStack needs to use a specific register; "
"in principle, a platform could choose to reserve and use another register "
"for ShadowCallStack, but this would be incompatible with the ABI standards "
"published in AAPCS64 and the RISC-V psABI."

"Special unwind information is required on functions that are compiled with "
"ShadowCallStack and that may be unwound, i.e. functions compiled with ``-"
"fexceptions`` (which is the default in C++). Some unwinders (such as the "
"libgcc 4.9 unwinder) do not understand this unwind info and will segfault "
"when encountering it. LLVM libunwind processes this unwind info correctly, "
"however. This means that if exceptions are used together with "
"ShadowCallStack, the program must use a compatible unwinder."

"The instrumentation makes use of the ``SCSReg`` register to reference the "
"shadow call stack, meaning that references to the shadow call stack do not "
"have to be stored in memory. This makes it possible to implement a runtime "
"that avoids exposing the address of the shadow call stack to attackers that "
"can read arbitrary memory. However, attackers could still try to exploit "
"side channels exposed by the operating system `[1]`_ `[2]`_ or processor "
"`[3]`_ to discover the address of the shadow call stack."

"Unless care is taken when allocating the shadow call stack, it may be "
"possible for an attacker to guess its address using the addresses of other "
"allocations. Therefore, the address should be chosen to make this difficult. "
"One way to do this is to allocate a large guard region without read/write "
"permissions, randomly select a small region within it to be used as the "
"address of the shadow call stack and mark only that region as read/write. "
"This also mitigates somewhat against processor side channels. The intent is "
"that the Android runtime `will do this`_, but the platform will first need "
"to be `changed`_ to avoid using ``setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS)`` to limit memory "
"allocations in certain processes, as this also limits the number of guard "
"regions that can be allocated."

"The runtime will need the address of the shadow call stack in order to "
"deallocate it when destroying the thread. If the entire program is compiled "
"with ``SCSReg`` reserved, this is trivial: the address can be derived from "
"the value stored in ``SCSReg`` (e.g. by masking out the lower bits). If a "
"guard region is used, the address of the start of the guard region could "
"then be stored at the start of the shadow call stack itself. But if it is "
"possible for code compiled without reserving ``SCSReg`` to run on a thread "
"managed by the runtime, which is the case on Android for example, the "
"address must be stored somewhere else instead. On Android we store the "
"address of the start of the guard region in TLS and deallocate the entire "
"guard region including the shadow call stack at thread exit. This is "
"considered acceptable given that the address of the start of the guard "
"region is already somewhat guessable."

"One way in which the address of the shadow call stack could leak is in the "
"``jmp_buf`` data structure used by ``setjmp`` and ``longjmp``. The Android "
"runtime `avoids this`_ by only storing the low bits of ``SCSReg`` in the "
"``jmp_buf``, which requires the address of the shadow call stack to be "
"aligned to its size."

"To enable ShadowCallStack, just pass the ``-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack`` "
"flag to both compile and link command lines. On aarch64, you also need to "
"pass ``-ffixed-x18`` unless your target already reserves ``x18``. No "
"additional flags need to be passed on RISC-V because the software based "
"shadow stack uses ``x3`` (``gp``), which is always reserved, and the "
"hardware based shadow call stack uses a dedicated register, ``ssp``. "
"However, it is important to disable GP relaxation in the linker when using "
"the software based shadow call stack on RISC-V. This can be done with the "
"``--no-relax-gp`` flag in GNU ld, and is off by default in LLD."
