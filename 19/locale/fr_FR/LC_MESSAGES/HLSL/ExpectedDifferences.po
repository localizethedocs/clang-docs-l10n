"HLSL currently has two reference compilers, the `DirectX Shader Compiler "
"(DXC) <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/>`_ and the "
"`Effect-Compiler (FXC) <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/"
"direct3dtools/fxc>`_. The two reference compilers do not fully agree. Some "
"known disagreements in the references are tracked on `DXC's GitHub <https://"
"github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues?"
"q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afxc-disagrees>`_, but many more are known to "
"exist."

"HLSL as implemented by Clang will also not fully match either of the "
"reference implementations, it is instead being written to match the `draft "
"language specification <https://microsoft.github.io/hlsl-specs/specs/hlsl."

"Most of the intended differences between Clang and the earlier reference "
"compilers are focused on increased consistency and correctness. Both "
"reference compilers do not always apply language rules the same in all "
"contexts."

#: ../../../HLSL/ExpectedDifferences.rst:34
msgid ""
"Clang also deviates from the reference compilers by providing different "
"diagnostics, both in terms of the textual messages and the contexts in which "
"diagnostics are produced. While striving for a high level of source "
"compatibility with conforming HLSL code, Clang may produce earlier and more "
"robust diagnostics for incorrect code or reject code that a reference "
"compiler incorrectly accepted."

#: ../../../HLSL/ExpectedDifferences.rst:116
msgid ""
"In Clang, a conscious decision was made to exclude the ``dot(vector<double,"
"N>, vector<double,N>)`` overload and allow overload resolution to resolve "
"the ``vector<float,N>`` overload. This approach provides ``-Wconversion`` "
"diagnostic notifying the user of the conversion rather than silently "
"altering precision relative to the other overloads (as FXC does) or "
"generating code that will fail validation (as DXC does)."
