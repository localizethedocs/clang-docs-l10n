"Clang includes an implementation of a number of control flow integrity (CFI) "
"schemes, which are designed to abort the program upon detecting certain "
"forms of undefined behavior that can potentially allow attackers to subvert "
"the program's control flow. These schemes have been optimized for "
"performance, allowing developers to enable them in release builds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:22
msgid ""
"To enable Clang's available CFI schemes, use the flag ``-fsanitize=cfi``. "
"You can also enable a subset of available :ref:`schemes <cfi-schemes>`. As "
"currently implemented, all schemes rely on link-time optimization (LTO); so "
"it is required to specify ``-flto``, and the linker used must support LTO, "
"for example via the `gold plugin`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:28
msgid ""
"To allow the checks to be implemented efficiently, the program must be "
"structured such that certain object files are compiled with CFI enabled, and "
"are statically linked into the program. This may preclude the use of shared "
"libraries in some cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:33
msgid ""
"The compiler will only produce CFI checks for a class if it can infer hidden "
"LTO visibility for that class. LTO visibility is a property of a class that "
"is inferred from flags and attributes. For more details, see the "
"documentation for :doc:`LTO visibility <LTOVisibility>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:38
msgid ""
"The ``-fsanitize=cfi-{vcall,nvcall,derived-cast,unrelated-cast}`` flags "
"require that a ``-fvisibility=`` flag also be specified. This is because the "
"default visibility setting is ``-fvisibility=default``, which would disable "
"CFI checks for classes without visibility attributes. Most users will want "
"to specify ``-fvisibility=hidden``, which enables CFI checks for such "
"classes."

"security hardening mechanism designed to be deployed in release builds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:227
msgid ""
"``-fsanitize=function`` has a higher space and time overhead due to a more "
"complex type check at indirect call sites, as well as a need for run-time "
