"The default setting of FP contraction (FMA) is now -ffp-contract=on (for "
"languages other than CUDA/HIP) even when optimization is off. Previously, "
"the default behavior was equivalent to -ffp-contract=off (-ffp-contract was "
"not set). Related to this, the switch -ffp-model=precise now implies -ffp-"
"contract=on rather than -ffp-contract=fast, and the documentation of these "
"features has been clarified. Previously, the documentation claimed that -ffp-"
"model=precise was the default, but this was incorrect because the precise "
"model implied -ffp-contract=fast, whereas the (now corrected) default "
"behavior is -ffp-contract=on. -ffp-model=precise is now exactly the default "
"mode of the compiler."
