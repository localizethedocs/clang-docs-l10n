"ThreadSanitizer is a tool that detects data races.  It consists of a "
"compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library.  Typical slowdown "
"introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about **5x-15x**.  Typical memory overhead "
"introduced by ThreadSanitizer is about **5x-10x**."

#: ../../../ThreadSanitizer.rst:34
msgid ""
"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=thread``.  To get a "

"Some code should not be instrumented by ThreadSanitizer.  One may use the "
"function attribute ``no_sanitize(\"thread\")`` to disable instrumentation of "
"plain (non-atomic) loads/stores in a particular function.  ThreadSanitizer "
"still instruments such functions to avoid false positives and provide "
"meaningful stack traces.  This attribute may not be supported by other "
"compilers, so we suggest to use it together with "
"``__has_feature(thread_sanitizer)``."

msgid ""
"The ``disable_sanitizer_instrumentation`` attribute can be applied to "
"functions to prevent all kinds of instrumentation. As a result, it may "
"introduce false positives and incorrect stack traces. Therefore, it should "
"be used with care, and only if absolutely required; for example for certain "
"code that cannot tolerate any instrumentation and resulting side-effects. "

"ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in :doc:"
"`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports "
"in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with "
"``no_sanitize(\"thread\")`` attribute, ignored functions are not "
"instrumented at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed "
"synchronization via atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports."

"ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default "

"also available."

"Non-position-independent executables are not supported.  Therefore, the "

"ThreadSanitizer is a bug detection tool and its runtime is not meant to be "

"ThreadSanitizer is in beta stage.  It is known to work on large C++ programs "
