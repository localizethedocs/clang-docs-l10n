"Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=memory`` flag. The "
"MemorySanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, "
"so make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step. When "
"linking shared libraries, the MemorySanitizer run-time is not linked, so ``-"
"Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with MemorySanitizer). To "
"get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher. To get meaningful stack "
"traces in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect "
"stack traces you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail "
"call elimination (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``)."

"MemorySanitizer can track origins of uninitialized values, similar to "

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:143
msgid ""
"By default, MemorySanitizer collects both allocation points and all "
"intermediate stores the uninitialized value went through.  Origin tracking "
"has proved to be very useful for debugging MemorySanitizer reports. It slows "
"down program execution by a factor of 1.5x-2x on top of the usual "
"MemorySanitizer slowdown and increases memory overhead."

"MemorySanitizer requires that all program code is instrumented. This also "
"includes any libraries that the program depends on, even libc. Failing to "
"achieve this may result in false reports. For the same reason you may need "
"to replace all inline assembly code that writes to memory with a pure C/C++ "
"code."

#: ../../../MemorySanitizer.rst:177

"Full MemorySanitizer instrumentation is very difficult to achieve. To make "
"it easier, MemorySanitizer runtime library includes 70+ interceptors for the "
"most common libc functions. They make it possible to run MemorySanitizer-"
"instrumented programs linked with uninstrumented libc. For example, the "
"authors were able to bootstrap MemorySanitizer-instrumented Clang compiler "
"by linking it with self-built instrumented libc++ (as a replacement for "
"libstdc++)."
