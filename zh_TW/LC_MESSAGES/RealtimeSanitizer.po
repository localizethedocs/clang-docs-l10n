"RealtimeSanitizer (a.k.a. RTSan) is a real-time safety testing tool for C "
"and C++ projects. RTSan can be used to detect real-time violations, i.e. "
"calls to methods that are not safe for use in functions with deterministic "
"run time requirements. RTSan considers any function marked with the "
"``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` attribute to be a real-time function. At run-"
"time, if RTSan detects a call to ``malloc``, ``free``, "
"``pthread_mutex_lock``, or anything else known to have a non-deterministic "
"execution time in a function marked ``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` it raises an "
"error."

#: ../../../RealtimeSanitizer.rst:19
msgid ""
"RTSan performs its analysis at run-time but shares the ``[[clang::"
"nonblocking]]`` attribute with the :doc:`FunctionEffectAnalysis` system, "
"which operates at compile-time to detect potential real-time safety "
"violations. For comprehensive detection of real-time safety issues, it is "
"recommended to use both systems together."

"Functions that are subject to real-time constraints must be marked with the "
"``[[clang::nonblocking]]`` attribute."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../RealtimeSanitizer.rst:46
msgid ""
"Typically, these attributes should be added onto the functions that are "
"entry points for threads with real-time priority. These threads are subject "

"in video game code."

"Calls to system library functions such as ``malloc`` are automatically "

"blocking (real-time unsafe) functions that they wish RealtimeSanitizer to be "

"attributed with ``[[clang::blocking]]`` is called in a ``[[clang::"
