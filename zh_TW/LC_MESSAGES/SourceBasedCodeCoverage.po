"\"%Nm\" expands out to the instrumented binary's signature. When this "
"pattern is specified, the runtime creates a pool of N raw profiles which are "
"used for on-line profile merging. The runtime takes care of selecting a raw "
"profile from the pool, locking it, and updating it before the program "
"exits.  If N is not specified (i.e the pattern is \"%m\"), it's assumed that "
"``N = 1``. N must be between 1 and 9. The merge pool specifier can only "
"occur once per filename pattern."

"\"%c\" expands out to nothing, but enables a mode in which profile counter "
"updates are continuously synced to a file. This means that if the "
"instrumented program crashes, or is killed by a signal, perfect coverage "
"information can still be recovered. Continuous mode does not support value "
"profiling for PGO, and is only supported on Darwin at the moment. Support "
"for Linux may be mostly complete but requires testing, and support for "
"Fuchsia/Windows may require more extensive changes: please get involved if "
