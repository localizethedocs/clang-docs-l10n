"SanitizerStats can currently only be used with :doc:`ControlFlowIntegrity`. "
"In addition to ``-fsanitize=cfi*``, pass the ``-fsanitize-stats`` flag. This "
"will cause the program to count the number of times that each control flow "
"integrity check in the program fires."

"The output of ``sanstats`` is in four columns, separated by spaces. The "
"first column is the file and line number of the call site. The second column "
"is the function name. The third column is the type of statistic gathered (in "
"this case, the type of control flow integrity check). The fourth column is "
"the call count."
