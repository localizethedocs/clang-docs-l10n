":program:`clang` is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler which encompasses "
"preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code generation, assembly, and "
"linking. Depending on which high-level mode setting is passed, Clang will "
"stop before doing a full link.  While Clang is highly integrated, it is "
"important to understand the stages of compilation, to understand how to "
"invoke it.  These stages are:"

"The clang executable is actually a small driver which controls the overall "

"This stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a "
