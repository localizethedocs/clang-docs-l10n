"User of sanitizer tools, such as :doc:`AddressSanitizer`, :doc:"
"`ThreadSanitizer` or :doc:`MemorySanitizer` may want to disable or alter "
"some checks for certain source-level entities to:"

"To achieve this, user may create a file listing the entities they want to "
"ignore, and pass it to clang at compile-time using ``-fsanitize-blacklist`` "
"flag. See :doc:`UsersManual` for details."

"Blacklists consist of entries, optionally grouped into sections. Empty lines "
"and lines starting with \"#\" are ignored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SanitizerSpecialCaseList.rst:57
msgid ""
"Section names are regular expressions written in square brackets that denote "
"which sanitizer the following entries apply to. For example, ``[address]`` "
"specifies AddressSanitizer while ``[cfi-vcall|cfi-icall]`` specifies Control "
"Flow Integrity virtual and indirect call checking. Entries without a section "
"will be placed under the ``[*]`` section applying to all enabled sanitizers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SanitizerSpecialCaseList.rst:63
msgid ""
"Entries contain an entity type, followed by a colon and a regular "
"expression, specifying the names of the entities, optionally followed by an "
"equals sign and a tool-specific category, e.g. ``fun:"
"*ExampleFunc=example_category``.  The meaning of ``*`` in regular expression "
"for entity names is different - it is treated as in shell wildcarding. Two "
"generic entity types are ``src`` and ``fun``, which allow users to specify "
"source files and functions, respectively. Some sanitizer tools may introduce "
"custom entity types and categories - refer to tool-specific docs."
