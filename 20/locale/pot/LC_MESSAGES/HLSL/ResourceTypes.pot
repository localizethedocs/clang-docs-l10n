"HLSL Resources are runtime-bound data that is provided as input, output or "
"both to shader programs written in HLSL. Resource Types in HLSL provide key "
"user abstractions for reading and writing resource data."

"In Clang resource types are forward declared by the "
"``HLSLExternalSemaSource`` on initialization. They are then lazily completed "
"when ``requiresCompleteType`` is called later in Sema."

"Resource types are classes that have the \"intangible\" resource handle "
"type, `__hlsl_resource_t`, as a member. These are generally templated class "
"declarations that specify the type of data that can be loaded from or stored "
"into the resource. The handle is annotated with hlsl-specific attributes "
"describing properties of the resource. Member functions of a resource type "
"are generally fairly simple wrappers around builtins that operate on the "
"handle member."

"During code generation resource types are lowered to target extension types "
"in IR. These types are target specific and differ between DXIL and SPIR-V "
"generation, providing the necessary information for the targets to generate "
"binding metadata for their respective target runtimes."
