"HLSL Resources are runtime-bound data that is provided as input, output or "
"both to shader programs written in HLSL. Resource Types in HLSL provide key "
"user abstractions for reading and writing resource data."

"In Clang resource types are forward declared by the "
"``HLSLExternalSemaSource`` on initialization. They are then lazily completed "
"when ``requiresCompleteType`` is called later in Sema."

"Resource types are templated class declarations. The template parameter "
"specifies the expected return type of resource loads, and the expected "
"parameter type for stores."

#: ../../../HLSL/ResourceTypes.rst:26
msgid ""
"In Clang's AST and code generation, resource types are classes that store a "
"pointer of the template parameter type. The pointer is populated from a call "
"to ``__builtin_hlsl_create_handle``, and treated as a pointer to an array of "
"typed data through until lowering in the backend."

msgid ""
"Resource types are annotated with the ``HLSLResource`` attribute, which "
"drives code generation for resource binding metadata. The ``hlsl`` metadata "
"nodes are transformed in the backend to the binding information expected by "
"the target runtime."
