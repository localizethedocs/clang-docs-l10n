"**The Problem:** You have headers you want to use, but you also want to add "
"extra information to the API. You don't want to put that information in the "
"headers themselves --- perhaps because you want to keep them clean for other "
"clients, or perhaps because they're from some open source project and you "
"don't want to modify them at all."

"**Incomplete solution:** Redeclare all the interesting parts of the API in "
"your own header and add the attributes you want. Unfortunately, this:"

"**Better solution:** Provide a \"sidecar\" file with the information you "

"API notes use a YAML-based file format. YAML is a format best explained by "
"example, so here is a `small example <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/"
"blob/main/clang/test/APINotes/Inputs/Frameworks/SomeKit.framework/Headers/"
"SomeKit.apinotes>`_ from the compiler test suite of API notes for a "

#: ../../../APINotes.rst:34
msgid ""
"API notes files are found relative to the module map that defines a module, "
"under the name \"SomeKit.apinotes\" for a module named \"SomeKit\". "
"Additionally, a file named \"SomeKit_private.apinotes\" will also be picked "
"up to go with a private module map. For bare modules these two files will be "
"in the same directory as the corresponding module map; for framework "
"modules, they should be placed in the Headers and PrivateHeaders "
"directories, respectively. The module map for a private top-level framework "
"module should be placed in the PrivateHeaders directory as well, though it "
"does not need an additional \"_private\" suffix on its name."

"Many API notes affect how a C API is imported into Swift. In order to change "
"that behavior while still remaining backwards-compatible, API notes can be "
"selectively applied based on the Swift compatibility version provided to the "
"compiler (e.g. ``-fapi-notes-swift-version=5``). The rule is that an "
"explicitly-versioned API note applies to that version *and all earlier "
"versions,* and any applicable explicitly-versioned API note takes precedence "
"over an unversioned API note."
