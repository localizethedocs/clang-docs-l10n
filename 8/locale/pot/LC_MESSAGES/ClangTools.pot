"Clang Tools are standalone command line (and potentially GUI) tools designed "

"Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly used by "
"C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by Clang "
"developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers who happen "
"to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their functionality. They "
"are developed in three components: the underlying infrastructure for "
"building a standalone tool based on Clang, core shared logic used by many "
"different tools in the form of refactoring and rewriting libraries, and the "
"tools themselves."

"The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the :doc:`LibTooling "
"<LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much more detailed "
"information about how this infrastructure works. The common refactoring and "
"rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of LibTooling organizationally."

"A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as "
"examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of the "
"tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation from the "
"core libraries. We intentionally do not support public libraries in the side "
"repository, as we want to carefully review and find good APIs for libraries "
"as they are lifted out of a few tools and into the core Clang library set."

":doc:`ClangCheck` combines the LibTooling framework for running a Clang tool "

"diagnostics in different formats with different flags, suitable for use "
"driving an IDE or editor. Furthermore, it can be used in fixit-mode to "

"Clang-format is both a :doc:`library <LibFormat>` and a :doc:`stand-alone "
"tool <ClangFormat>` with the goal of automatically reformatting C++ sources "
"files according to configurable style guides.  To do so, clang-format uses "
"Clang's ``Lexer`` to transform an input file into a token stream and then "
"changes all the whitespace around those tokens.  The goal is for clang-"
"format to serve both as a user tool (ideally with powerful IDE integrations) "
"and as part of other refactoring tools, e.g. to do a reformatting of all the "
"lines changed during a renaming."
