"This tool works as a wrapper over a linking job. The tool is used to create "
"linked device images for offloading. It scans the linker's input for "
"embedded device offloading data stored in sections ``.llvm.offloading."
"<triple>.<arch>`` and extracts it as a temporary file. The extracted device "
"files will then be passed to a device linking job to create a final device "
"image."

"This tool links object files with offloading images embedded within it using "
"the ``-fembed-offload-object`` flag in Clang. Given an input file containing "
