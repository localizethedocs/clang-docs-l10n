"the program. If ``LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`` contains a path to a non-existent "

"Darwin, this is typically set to a temporary scratch directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:90
msgid ""
"\"%Nm\" expands out to the instrumented binary's signature. When this "
"pattern is specified, the runtime creates a pool of N raw profiles which are "
"used for on-line profile merging. The runtime takes care of selecting a raw "
"profile from the pool, locking it, and updating it before the program "
"exits.  If N is not specified (i.e the pattern is \"%m\"), it's assumed that "
"``N = 1``. The merge pool specifier can only occur once per filename pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:97
msgid ""
"\"%b\" expands out to the binary ID (build ID). It can be used with \"%Nm\" "
"to avoid binary signature collisions. To use it, the program should be "
"compiled with the build ID linker option (``--build-id`` for GNU ld or LLD, "
"``/build-id`` for lld-link on Windows). Linux, Windows and AIX are supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:102
msgid ""
"\"%c\" expands out to nothing, but enables a mode in which profile counter "
"updates are continuously synced to a file. This means that if the "
"instrumented program crashes, or is killed by a signal, perfect coverage "
"information can still be recovered. Continuous mode does not support value "
"profiling for PGO, and is only supported on Darwin at the moment. Support "
"for Linux may be mostly complete but requires testing, and support for "
"Windows may require more extensive changes: please get involved if you are "
"interested in porting this feature."

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:116
msgid ""
"Note that continuous mode is also used on Fuchsia where it's the only "
"supported mode, but the implementation is different. The Darwin and Linux "
"implementation relies on padding and the ability to map a file over the "
"existing memory mapping which is generally only available on POSIX systems "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:122
msgid ""
"On Fuchsia, we rely on the ability to relocate counters at runtime using a "
"level of indirection. On every counter access, we add a bias to the counter "
"address. This bias is stored in ``__llvm_profile_counter_bias`` symbol "
"that's provided by the profile runtime and is initially set to zero, meaning "
"no relocation. The runtime can map the profile into memory at arbitrary "
"locations, and set bias to the offset between the original and the new "
"counter location, at which point every subsequent counter access will be to "
"the new location, which allows updating profile directly akin to the "
"continuous mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:131
msgid ""
"The advantage of this approach is that doesn't require any special OS "
"support. The disadvantage is the extra overhead due to additional "
"instructions required for each counter access (overhead both in terms of "
"binary size and performance) plus duplication of counters (i.e. one copy in "
"the binary itself and another copy that's mapped into memory). This "
"implementation can be also enabled for other platforms by passing the ``-"
"runtime-counter-relocation`` option to the backend during compilation."

"Region coverage is the percentage of code regions which have been executed "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:297
msgid ""
"Branch coverage is the percentage of \"true\" and \"false\" branches that "
"have been taken at least once. Each branch is tied to individual conditions "
"in the source code that may each evaluate to either \"true\" or \"false\".  "
"These conditions may comprise larger boolean expressions linked by boolean "
"logical operators. For example, \"x = (y == 2) || (z < 10)\" is a boolean "
"expression that is comprised of two individual conditions, each of which "
"evaluates to either true or false, producing four total branch outcomes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../SourceBasedCodeCoverage.rst:305
msgid ""
"Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) is the percentage of individual "
"branch conditions that have been shown to independently affect the decision "
"outcome of the boolean expression they comprise. This is accomplished using "
"the analysis of executed control flow through the expression (i.e. test "
"vectors) to show that as a condition's outcome is varied between \"true\" "
"and false\", the decision's outcome also varies between \"true\" and "
"false\", while the outcome of all other conditions is held fixed (or they "
"are masked out as unevaluatable, as happens in languages whose logical "
"operators have short-circuit semantics).  MC/DC builds on top of branch "
"coverage and requires that all code blocks and all execution paths have been "
"tested.  This statistic is hidden by default in reports, but it can be "
"enabled via the ``-show-mcdc-summary`` option as long as code was also "
"compiled using the clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``."

"llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no "

"Branch regions are also generated for each switch case, including the "
"default case. If there is no explicitly defined default case in the source "
"code, a branch region is generated to correspond to the implicit default "
"case that is generated by the compiler.  The implicit branch region is tied "
"to the line and column number of the switch statement condition since no "
"source code for the implicit case exists."
