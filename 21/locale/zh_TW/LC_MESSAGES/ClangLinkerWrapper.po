"This tool works as a wrapper of the normal host linking job. This tool is "
"used to create linked device images for offloading and the necessary runtime "
"calls to register them. It works by first scanning the linker's input for "
"embedded device offloading data stored at the ``.llvm.offloading`` section. "
"This section contains binary data created by the :doc:"
"`ClangOffloadPackager`. The extracted device files will then be linked. The "
"linked modules will then be wrapped into a new object file containing the "
"code necessary to register it with the offloading runtime."

"This tool can be used with the following options. Any arguments not intended "
"only for the linker wrapper will be forwarded to the wrapped linker job."

msgid ""
"The ``clang-linker-wrapper`` handles linking embedded device code and then "
"registering it with the appropriate runtime. Normally, this is only done "
"when the executable is created so other files containing device code can be "
"linked together. This can be somewhat problematic for users who wish to ship "
"static libraries that contain offloading code to users without a compatible "
"offloading toolchain."

#: ../../../ClangLinkerWrapper.rst:73
msgid ""
"When using a relocatable link with ``-r``, the ``clang-linker-wrapper`` will "
"perform the device linking and registration eagerly. This will remove the "
"embedded device code and register it correctly with the runtime. "
"Semantically, this is similar to creating a shared library object. If "
"standard relocatable linking is desired, simply do not run the binaries "
"through the ``clang-linker-wrapper``. This will simply append the embedded "
"device code so that it can be linked later."

msgid "Matching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangLinkerWrapper.rst:84
msgid ""
"The linker wrapper will link extracted device code that is compatible with "
"each other. Generally, this requires that the target triple and architecture "
"match. An exception is made when the architecture is listed as ``generic``, "
"which will cause it be linked with any other device code with the same "
"target triple."

#: ../../../ClangLinkerWrapper.rst:92
msgid ""
"The linker wrapper performs a lot of steps internally, such as input "
"matching, symbol resolution, and image registration. This makes it difficult "
"to debug in some scenarios. The behavior of the linker-wrapper is controlled "
"mostly through metadata, described in `clang documentation <https://clang."
"llvm.org/docs/OffloadingDesign.html>`_. Intermediate output can be obtained "
"from the linker-wrapper using the ``--save-temps`` flag. These files can "
"then be modified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangLinkerWrapper.rst:107
msgid ""
"Doing this will allow you to override one of the input files by replacing "
"its embedded offloading metadata with a user-modified version. However, this "
"will be more difficult when there are multiple input files. For a very large "
"hammer, the ``--override-image=<kind>=<file>`` flag can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../ClangLinkerWrapper.rst:112
msgid ""
"In the following example, we use the ``--save-temps`` to obtain the LLVM-IR "
"just before running the backend. We then modify it to test altered behavior, "
"and then compile it to a binary. This can then be passed to the linker-"
"wrapper which will then ignore all embedded metadata and use the provided "
"image as if it were the result of the device linking phase."

msgid ""
"This tool links object files with offloading images embedded within it using "
"the ``-fembed-offload-object`` flag in Clang. Given an input file containing "
"the magic section we can pass it to this tool to extract the data contained "
"at that section and run a device linking job on it."
