"Pointer authentication is a technology which offers strong probabilistic "
"protection against exploiting a broad class of memory bugs to take control "
"of program execution.  When adopted consistently in a language ABI, it "
"provides a form of relatively fine-grained control flow integrity (CFI) "
"check that resists both return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented "
"programming (JOP) attacks."

"While pointer authentication can be implemented purely in software, direct "
"hardware support (e.g. as provided by Armv8.3 PAuth) can dramatically "
"improve performance and code size.  Similarly, while pointer authentication "
"can be implemented on any architecture, taking advantage of the (typically) "
"excess addressing range of a target with 64-bit pointers minimizes the "
"impact on memory performance and can allow interoperation with existing code "
"(by disabling pointer authentication dynamically).  This document will "
"generally attempt to present the pointer authentication feature independent "
"of any hardware implementation or ABI.  Considerations that are "
"implementation-specific are clearly identified throughout."
